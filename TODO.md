# Unpythonic

This repo contains various bits of code that are "unpythonic", but, for one reason or another, I thought were worth keeping around.  I do not guarantee that:

 - Things will work
 - Things will continue to work in the future
 - Your computer will not explode

That being said, if you notice a bug, feel free to open an issue/pull request.
